# Roadmap to Mind Protocol 1.0

This roadmap tracks **protocol stabilization only**. Concrete personal minds, organization minds, agent minds, named visual assets, provider bindings, product renderers, and ecosystem rollouts are separate implementation concerns.

The north star is a small implementation-independent contract for typed identity, context, relationships, provenance, visual identity references, resource loading, compatibility, and deterministic conformance.

Formal publication policy is defined in [`RELEASE_POLICY.md`](RELEASE_POLICY.md).

## Version axes

Mind keeps independent version axes for protocol semantics, descriptor/manifest shapes, concrete context, and typed resource schemas. A protocol release never implies a concrete context release, and a concrete context change never implies a protocol release.

Published schema identities are versioned independently from protocol releases. When one schema shape intentionally survives across the `0.9.0` → `1.0.0-rc.1` → `1.0.0-rc.2` → `1.0.0` train, release-specific version/lifecycle bindings belong in semantic validation rather than forcing byte changes under the same `$id`.

## 0.4 — readable protocol foundation

Status: **stable source milestone**

Delivered explicit subject/owner semantics, typed module resources, manifest schema v2, and universal visual-reference shape.

## 0.5 — relationships and provenance

Status: **accepted semantics carried forward**

Delivered authored relationship direction, provenance, reciprocal confirmation, and provider-independent canonical relationship identity.

## 0.6 — Identity and canonical visual contract

Status: **`0.6.0` stable source milestone**

Delivered universal Identity/resource separation, deterministic canonical visual resolution/failure semantics, and independent protocol/context versioning.

No retroactive formal GitHub Release is planned for `0.6.0`.

## 0.7 — agent identity semantics

Status: **`0.7.0` stable source milestone**

Delivered first-class agent Identity through the same universal schema, subject/owner independence, and explicit runtime/personhood/portrait boundaries.

No retroactive formal GitHub Release is planned for `0.7.0`.

## 0.8 — neutral baseline and conformance

Status: **`0.8.0` stable source milestone**

Delivered:

- protocol descriptor schema `v2` with discoverable conformance policy;
- deterministic generated neutral baseline rather than a long-lived generic ontology;
- dynamic tests preventing concrete `mind@0x0sky` data from leaking into the baseline;
- synthetic fixture descriptors for person, organization, agent, project, and product;
- explicit deterministic expected result for every required fixture;
- a machine-runnable conformance suite and feature matrix;
- suite and per-consumer support range `[0.8.0, 0.9.0)`;
- two independent consumer modes (`schema` and `minimal`) over the same fixture set;
- both modes preserving authored provenance and rejecting derived evidence from canonical authored relationships;
- both modes resolving a valid canonical visual mark and reporting integrity failure deterministically;
- explicit unknown optional-module and required-module behavior in both modes;
- repeated-run regression proof that consumer outputs are reproducible;
- neutral protocol schema `$id` namespace rather than reference-repository GitHub URLs.

Acceptance evidence:

- neutral baseline generation is byte-for-byte deterministic;
- all five required fixture types validate;
- fixture and probe results are reproducible;
- both independent consumer modes pass the declared suite;
- reference-instance content is rejected from the generated baseline;
- supported protocol ranges are machine-readable.

`0.8.0` remains a source milestone and will not be retroactively promoted into the first formal release.

## 0.9 — compatibility freeze

Status: **`0.9.0` published formal release; compatibility canaries green**.

`0.9.0` is the **first formal GitHub Release**.

The release froze the public compatibility surface before `1.0`:

- remove `mind.kind` in favor of the canonical `mind.subject.type`;
- remove `public_organizations` from the provider-agnostic root manifest;
- preserve organization semantics through canonical relationships or provider integrations before migration;
- use manifest schema `v3` as the frozen pre-1.0 root shape;
- freeze Identity, resource-envelope, relationships/provenance, loading/module discovery, visual-reference, baseline, conformance, and compatibility contracts;
- freeze exact published schema contents through machine-validated fingerprints;
- keep release numbers and lifecycle states out of reusable schema bytes when the same `$id` is intended to survive the release train;
- enforce exact protocol version, lifecycle state, and migration-source binding semantically;
- keep `module` as the capability negotiation unit;
- reject unknown root-manifest fields unless a future manifest schema revision explicitly introduces them;
- preserve forward compatibility through unknown optional modules that are not requested;
- reject unknown required/default-loaded modules;
- define the `1.x` compatibility policy;
- support migration from stable protocol lines beginning at `0.6.0`;
- prohibit provider-login-to-canonical-id inference;
- prohibit new root-manifest concepts without protocol-wide evidence.

Release evidence is complete: the final PR CI was green, the merge tree matched the tested head tree, and immutable `v0.9.0` plus its formal GitHub Release were published from the verified commit.

### Post-`0.9.0` compatibility canaries

The deliberately small real-canary set synchronized to the exact `0.9.0` release before `1.0.0-rc.1`:

- `0x0sky/mind`;
- `aiaiaiai-org/mind`;
- `0xda-market/mind`;
- `nilx-one/mind`.

P5 acceptance is green: four real minds validate, no unclassified failure remains, and protocol-vs-implementation ownership is explicit for every finding.

This phase was compatibility evidence only. It exercised manifest/resource migration, exact protocol pinning, canonical-vs-provider identity boundaries, authored provenance, optional modules, and already-defined visual behavior without making a named identity, provider, renderer, or repository protocol authority.

Full named identity, visual-family, provider-binding, agent, project/product, and ecosystem synchronization remains deferred until stable `1.0.0`.

## `1.0.0-rc.1` — first final-contract candidate

Status: **published immutable GitHub prerelease**.

`rc.1` proved the frozen contract through:

- strict SemVer 2.0 prerelease precedence for supported-range evaluation;
- clean-checkout full conformance;
- clean neutral-baseline generation;
- all required synthetic identity-type fixtures;
- visual resolution/failure fixtures;
- supported pre-1.0 migrations, including the formal `0.9.0` line;
- unknown optional-capability behavior;
- no named-identity dependency;
- no required provider dependency;
- no semantic drift from the frozen `0.9` surface except deliberately reviewed finalization required for `1.0`.

The RC range is `[1.0.0-rc.1, 1.0.0)`. Stable `1.0.0` is therefore not accidentally accepted as an RC-range member.

After publication, all four real canary Minds validated against the exact immutable `rc.1` release. A repository/bootstrap tooling defect was then identified: canonical bootstrap output did not record exact release repository/tag/commit provenance in the same shape already proven by the real consumers. The published `rc.1` tag and release remain untouched.

## `1.0.0-rc.2` — corrected canonical-bootstrap integration candidate

Current source milestone: **`1.0.0-rc.2` candidate**. Formal publication remains a separate GitHub prerelease action after green PR/tree verification.

`rc.2` deliberately changes no frozen universal protocol semantics and no published JSON Schema bytes. It promotes the corrected standalone concrete-Mind creation path:

- exact protocol authority remains `aiaiaiai-org/mind-protocol`;
- bootstrap requires the checked-out `HEAD` to equal the requested immutable release tag commit;
- generated `mind-repository.yaml` records exact release repository, tag, and commit;
- generated `protocol.lock.yaml` records the same exact release provenance;
- floating `master` consumption is forbidden;
- generated output is deterministic for identical inputs;
- new concrete Minds are standalone consumers rather than forks/copies of another concrete Mind.

The conformance support range remains `[1.0.0-rc.1, 1.0.0)` because this correction is compatible with the already-frozen universal contract.

Before stable promotion, the exact published `rc.2` release must be exercised by the four real Minds and by the independent `mind-web` create/load/auth/repair path. A blocking universal defect requires another RC rather than stable-only semantic drift.

## `1.0.0` — stable Mind Protocol

Publication: **first compatibility-guaranteed stable GitHub Release**.

The first compatibility-guaranteed protocol must provide implementation-independent Identity, explicit subject/owner, typed versioned resources, authored-vs-derived provenance, deterministic relationship and visual semantics, privacy/visibility boundaries, deterministic loading, optional-capability forward compatibility, provider-agnostic core, machine-readable supported range, reproducible neutral baseline, a public conformance suite, and one canonical deterministic standalone bootstrap path.

Required synthetic fixture coverage remains person, organization, agent, project, and product.

`1.0.0` should be a stable promotion of the accepted final RC contract. Semantic change after the final RC requires renewed review and conformance evidence. Stable publication waits for corrected `rc.2` consumer synchronization and the independent `mind-web` integration path to be proven.

## After `1.0.0` — full concrete identity rollout

Only after the compatibility-guaranteed stable protocol is published does the narrow canary phase expand into the full ecosystem identity rollout.

This separate implementation phase includes, as appropriate:

- canonical personal identity content;
- parent and child organization identities;
- agent identities;
- canonical named visual assets and the shared visual family;
- provider bindings;
- project and product identities where they are genuinely sovereign minds;
- synchronization into protocol consumers and ecosystem repositories.

Identity rollout **consumes** Mind Protocol `1.0`; named identities and their rollout state do not become protocol authority.

## Non-goals for 1.0

The core protocol does not require a full corporate brand system, typography/marketing voice, rich portraits, animation/3D semantics, AI runtime configuration, private conversation archives, provider-specific enrichment, deployment topology, migration of every named identity, or forcing every project/product into a sovereign mind.
